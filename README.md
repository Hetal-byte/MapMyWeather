# MapMyWeather
MapMyWeather shows where you are on the map and tells you what the sky’s doing there — sunny, rainy, or cloudy — in real time. No clutter, no fuss. Just your location, live weather, and a map that feels like it knows you.

# 🌍 MapMyWeather

This is a weather-based web app I’m building where your current location shows up on a live map along with real-time weather overlays.  
Right now, it detects your location and adds a cloud layer to the map using OpenWeatherMap.  
This is just Day 1 — more magic is coming. 🌦️✨
